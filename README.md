# single-price-grid-component

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
